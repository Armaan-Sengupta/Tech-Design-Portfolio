Although I have taught students before, mostly in computer science and robotics, it was all done face to face. What I learned was how to make a video, where you do not know who is watching it, nor can you take their questions. Teaching in that manner is very different, and I have gotten better at doing it because of the Arduino tutorials we create. This helps me of course when making similar educational videos, but also just to express my thoughts and ideas to&nbsp;colleagues and higher-ups in a way so that everyone understands me.</p>

I am now familiar with using a 3D printer, laser cutter, bandsaw, dremel, sander, drill press, and milling machine. While each has it's own&nbsp;niche, they all help in the process of transforming idea into reality. I was able to use the 3D printer to make intricate parts for my optics project. I was able to use the laser cutter, to&nbsp;precisely and neatly cut out walls for my dream house. I was able to use the dremel, bandsaw, drill press, and milling machine to modify existing parts, so that they would fit our aplication in robotics. Knowing how to use theese machines and tools helps me quickly, and precisely transform ideas into products.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mb-5 pt-3 mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">I first started creating websites in grade 7, with the Wix website editor. Since than I have been using it ever since for almost all projects if the option is available. It should be safe to say that I am very comfortable with using it's massive&nbsp;arsenal of tools. Wix was my go to website builder until this project, where it was not allowed. For this project I found a new tool, Mobrise. Mobrise allows you to make your website with graphical tools, but it also gives you the source code so that you can modify it, or host it any where you want. It is a great free service, however as it is to be expected with a free service, it still does not compare to wix. Regardless of what tool I use, I feel that websites are the single best way to present ideas to a audience you are not directly presenting to. I infact like it more than videos (<a href="presentation.html">which I like a lot</a>), because a website can host several different videos (like in my <a href="https://senguptaarmaan.wixsite.com/optica-technica" target="_blank">optics project</a>) and much more. I have used this skill to make my personal robotics team a website where people can learn about us and our robots. Having the skill to build a website is fundemental theese days if you want to attract attention towards a issue, product, belif, or really anything.</p>

Understanding that is equally, if not more important, than knowing how to code the arduino. I started playing with the arduino in grade 7, and I thought I knew a considerable amount about electronics, I was wrong. Taking the computer engineering course showed me the much larger world of electronics, and forced me to teach my self the theoretical fundementals of science that occur in the background of a simple LED or push button. From learning about quantum computing and computer hardware to learning how electrons interact with microscopic relays, I now know a lot more about electronics, and I am still learning. This of course helped me in Tech Design - Arduino unit, where I was able to write code, and explain circuts without having to learn anything new, but it also helps me in other areas such as robotics, where having strong fundementals in electronics often helps me to diagnose problems with our FRC robot. While this skill is not as generally helpful to many industrys, the program I want to go into (mechatronics engineering), will require a strong understanding of electrcity and electronic components.</p>
